# Machine Learning on Zoo Animals
Predicts an animal's classification based on its traits. You get to pick out of ten animals excluded from the training data and it returns the classification of that animal. 

zoo_machine_learning.py is where the program actually is. best_model.py is the file where I figured out which machine learning algorithm was the best for this set of data
